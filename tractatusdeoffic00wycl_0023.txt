INTRODUCTION. xix

if still unreconciled to the Church, could be handed over
to the secular power and consigned to prison. Accord-

ingly Wyclif devotes pp. 166-176 to a detailed consider-
ation of the power of excommunicating and the abuses
attending its exercise. It is shown that excommunication
can only harm a man in so far as he has previously been
harmed by his own sin. For a real excommunication
there must be a special revelation, and those who
employ this weapon from interested motives must
beware lest it recoil on themselves. In all scripture we
can find no instance of excommunication save (1) by way
of punishment to save the soul of the sinner, (2) by way
of handing over to Satan those who are already his own,
and are harming the Church‚ (3) by way of forbidding
intercourse with those who are impenitent after a triple
exhortation, (4) as a general malediction against evil-
doers. It is the third kind of excommunication which
is used and unscripturally extended by our prelates,
who turn the triple exhortation into a triple summons
to pay, and sacrifice the whole medicinal power of their
sentences for pecuniary gain. Such excommunications
ought not to be supported by imprisonment, and, with
one of the few touches of humour in the treatise, Wyclif
grimly quotes the words of the layman who told the
excommunicating priest that his medicine was so bad
that in future he might keep it for himself.

In the Reformer’s exposition of his third law, that for
the extension, defence and reform of the theological
faculty, he begins by upholding the strict interpreta-
tion of the decree of Pope Honorius ordering all
‘religious’ persons attending lectures on law or physic
to return to their convents within two months under
pain of excommunication. Every science must be
judged by its usefulness as a handmaid of theology, and
prelates who now exact money from theologians for
permission to study, should be made to contribute to

their support, and no one save a theologian should be
