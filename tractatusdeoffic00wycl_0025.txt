INTRODUCTION. xxi

the clergy is more perfect as more adapted for earning
bliss, but that its greatness must be wholly apart from the
world, while the King must remain secularly supreme.
The point next considered (p. 198) is that of the
meaning to be attached to the phrase the King's
liegeman (homo legz'ns regis). According to Wyclif's
definition anyone subject to the King's law is his liege-
man‚ and he thus expressly includes all foreigners
resident in, or even passing through, England. Such
foreigners‚ of course, owe allegiance also to the King of
the country in which they were born, and in opposition
to those who blindly quote the text ‘ No man can serve
two masters’ Wyclif proceeds to justify the possibility
of this double allegiance. Thus it is: shown that a man
may faithfully serve each of two masters who are
opposed to each other, so long as he is alive to the
different ways of serving, for it must always be remem-
bered that we may serve by resistance as well as by
compliance.

The third objection considered makes the reason of
the second more clear, for it would except the Pope,
the mendicant orders and foreign envoys from the class
of liegemen. Of such exceptions Wyclif will not hear.
Christ when on earth was content to be the liegernan of
Herod and of Caesar, and so whoever enjoys the protec-
tion of the King’s laws and owes them obedience is the
King's liegeman. Nay more, the mendicant orders and the
clergy are indebted to the King for special privileges;
the mendicant orders for the right of building their
private churches and for license to*- beg, and the clergy
for those powers of citation, fining and imprisonment
which they so grossly abuse. They are thus especially
bound to own the King’s authority, while the league
by which the friars make over to the Pope the rights of
lordship over all temporalities given thern as alms‚ is

prejudicial to the secular lords and should be resisted
from the out'set.
