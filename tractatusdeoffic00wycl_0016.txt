xii INTRODUCTION.

cording to the divine will, by supporting the clergy
according to the law of the Lord and by punishing
severely their degenerate members, Especially he is
bound to see that the clergy live upon their tithes and
private alms‚ as the Levites of old, and to deprive them
of the temporal lordship which they have unscripturally
acquired. His power over the temporalities of his realm
gives him the right to do this, and if the wishes of
‘pious founders' are alleged, there is the ready answer

a consideration of the extent of the royal power. This
seems naturally to embrace everything under the king’s
secular dominion‚ and the immense advantage accruing
to a realm from good clergy and the danger to which it
is exposed by spiritual treachery (even if this only takes

sound theologians, to whom the King should assign all
benefices in mortmain. This would be no wrong either
to the Papal Court or to private patronS‚ for the present
system, though it may accidentally admit good men, is
