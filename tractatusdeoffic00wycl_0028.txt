xxiv INTRODUCTION.

Lastly, Wyclif again approaches the question of the
obedience due from Bishops to their secular Prince.
For this, he shows, we have the example not only of the
priests of the Old Testament but of Christ and his
Apostles, examples which are enforced in the teaching
of St. Gregory. But our modern prelates deride Christ's
humility‚ and woe to the land where these men have
rule. The three laws proposed in Chapter VII are
again put forward as the only means of averting national
destruction.

In Chapter XI (pp. 245—260) a third principal objec-
tion is considered ; this time a most comprehensive one.
A King's work, it is held, is to fight and win dominion,
and since there is no reason why one person capable of
acquiring universal dominion should hold it rather than
another, any one competitor may fight with any other.
To this plea for anarchy Wyclif answers with the
assertion of the principles that the body politic must
have one head, that two men cannot be in all respects
equally fitted for headship, and that Nature does not
produce a fit man for him to be wasted. The assump-
tion os a general state of conquest-seeking is a false one.
The unity we need is not a unity obtained by common
subjection to a single individual, but that which
follows from the continual presence in the human race
of the genus of divinely endowed captains. In the
political community reason declares that each people
should have its own head, as we' in England have our
King. As for the Roman Empire, its life is gone, its
Emperor allows his wolves to destroy us, and England
is too remote from Rome for his rule here to be effectual.
In the powerlessness of its Emperor and the division
caused by the desire of the clergy for secular power we
see the fulfilment of Daniel’s prophecy (ii. 40 sq.).
Such an interpretation is not pleasing to our clergy,
who murmur against anyone who lays bare the sense of
Scripture to their reproof, sor the cause os the whole
