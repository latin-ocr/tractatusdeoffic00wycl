grounds, (b) on prior grounds, (c) under a greater penalty,
than to obey his Abbot; that king and priest alike are
both body and soul, and that all obedience must be for
the edification of the Church, and may therefore take
the form of resistance to unreasonable commands. The
King, it is added, should demand of all foreign Clergy
entering England an oath of loyalty‚ and thus reduce
the number of foreign traitors.

In the third objection the superiority of the monastic:
to the secular life was assumed ; in the fourth (p. 108) it
is argumentatively supported as a reason for the su-
periority of monastic obedience and Wyclif thus gains
an opportunity of inveighing against the doctrine that
the superadded form of monasticism is more perfect
than the simple religion of Christ. To him it appears
that the status of the extraclaustral clergy instituted
by Christ is the most perfect, though the claustral life
may be better for this or that individual. If we can
attain the same perfection without monastic forms as
with them, it is simpler and better to do without them,
and some cogent questions are suggested which any one
tempted to enter a monastic· order should ask of those
who are trying to persuade him to sacrifice that liberty
of action by which, according to St. Augustine‚ merit is
increased.

In Chapter VI (pp. 118—152) Wyclif first turns again
to the question of the extent of the royal jurisdiction,
holding that, since the sin of any individua] weakens
the kingdom, the King may enquire into all sins. Epi-
scopal jurisdiction is derived from the King, and the
bishops who· administer it are the king’s liegemen.
Certain sins also, such as thest, homicide and rape are
punishable in the king’s secular courts. The King’s
power to correct the clergy is further proved by the
demand of Pope Urban for secular help against the
Antipope, while the need for the secular lords to sup-
plement the power of the clergy, who may not themselves
