INTRODUCTION. xi

as the Apostle bids them, at once rich and poor. That
they have mistaken the honour appropriate to their pro-
fession is the real cause of the present degeneracy of
the Church. The Decretal thus explained becomes
quite Wycliffian, but it is open to doubt whether In-
nocent III would have recognised the interpretation.
The chapter 1 which follows (pp. 46-6 5) shows Wyclif
at his best. It is clearly written, interrupted by no
digressions‚ and admirable in its spirit. For a full
analysis the reader must be referred to the side-notes:
here only a brief summary can be attempted. The
duties of a King are considered under three heads ac-
cording as they are incumbent on him, (i) as man, (ii) as
head of his household, (iii) as King. As man his chief
duty is to be wise, and to this end he must have good
counsellors and such as are well acquainted with the
divine law. As head of his household he must see that
each of the three classes of his servants fulfil their
duties. His soldiers must obey the words of St. John
the Baptist, and his inferior ministers must serve God
as well as their earthly master, and live in charity
among themselves. Above all, his domestic clergy must
be free from crime and especially from simony, they
must not engage in lay work, but in their contempt of
the world, their affability and their truth, must set an
example to all. Lastly as King the monarch must re-
member that good government consists in the ordain-
ment of few and just laws, which he must enforce wisely
and promptly‚ and never dispense with save for the
most cogent reasons; for the King must bow to legal
institutions in reality and not merely in show. Again
the King must remember that he is God's vicar and that
he must act as such, by governing himself humbly ac-

1 By a most unfortunate piece of carelessness on my part this Chapter
heading is omitted from page 46. ‘ Capitulum III’ does not occur in the
MSS, but the rubrication of the word ‘Habitoa’ and the fresh subject,
suffieiently mark the new departure. [A. W. P.]
