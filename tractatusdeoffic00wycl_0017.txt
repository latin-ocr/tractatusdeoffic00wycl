INTRODUCTION. xiii

generally simoniacal. Spiritual purity would be re-
stored if bishops kept curates strictly to their proper
work, and if the people refused to pay the salaries of
notorious offenders.

At this point (page 77), with a somewhat abrupt
change, Wyclif returns to the consideration of the royal
duties ancl insists on the necessity that the King should
observe justice, the brightest of the virtues, He is to
govern for his subjects‘ good, and is secularly more
bound to thern than they to him, and must render them
the greater service. This leads to a disquisition on the
nature of true obedience, which may at times ‘obey by
resisting,’ as opposed to that merely superficial obedience
which allows a servant to give his lunatic master the
sword for which he calls that he may use it to his
destruction. Thus the antithesis of true obedience is
the consenting in sin, and this consent is of five kinds,
(i) by authorization, as in the case of the King who
refuses to withdraw clerical temporalities‚ (ii) by counsel‚
a worse sin than action, (iii) by defence, i.e. by sym-
pathy with evil or carelessness in correcting it, the
sin which tempora] lords incur by their defence of
clerical privileges, (iv) by voluntary co-operation as
in simony‚ and (v) by the withholding of spiritual
help. All these sins of consent are damnable indeed
in a secular prince, but much worse and more dangerous
in priestS.

Chapter V (pp. 90-118) is devoted to answering four
objections. Of these the first is purely trivial‚ since it
contends that inasmuch as whatever is done by the
king's liegeman is done by the king therefore the king
is a craftsman‚ a mummer, etc„ and as such of no
account. This argument is reduced to absurdity by
applying equally well to God, and Wyclif passes on
to a general enquiry as to the conditions under which
the acts of subjects may be ascribed to their superiors,
concluding that this transfer of responsibility requires
