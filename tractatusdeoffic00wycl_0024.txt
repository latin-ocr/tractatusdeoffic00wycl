appointed to any benefice. In connexion with this
doctrine Wyclif traces the history of presentation
(p. 182), and shows how the ultimate lordship still rests
with the King, who is charged with seeing that sacred
things are put to their lawful uses, and for the correction
of the clergy may intervene coercively by confiscating
their temporalities. Again‚ since the King is to defend
theology, in the spirit of Pope Honorius he must remove
all obstacles to it, and must therefore forbid all lectures
on the Civil Law. With curious inconsistency the Pope,
at the instance of the King of France, has forbidden
the Civil Law to be studied in Paris, but permits it in
England. The condemnation should be made general,
and since the Law of Christ is easier, more sufficing
and wholesomer, why should we keep even the Canon
Law? If it is said that the Roman Civil Law is dis-
tinguished for logical subtlety, and justice, the same
holds good for our own English law. Nor is it to the
point that it is helpful for the understanding of Canon
Law> since the authority of this rests not in Civil Law,
but in Scriptum, and the same reply may be made to
the contention that Civil Law is essential to the decision
of cases under the Law of Arms.

Chapter VIII (pp. 195—217) begins with the words:
F z'nalz'ter restat addere supplementa in declaracz'onem
materie supradicte, and is chiefly devoted to the eluci-
dation of four points to which ‘objection might be taken.
In this supplement Wyclif first shows himself anxious
to make his teaching clear on the subject of the relations
between kings and priests, and to prove that some
words which he had used earlier in his treatise
(apparently on page 143) are not inconsistent with the
belief that the power of the ministry of the priest is
greater than that of the King which is ordained to hire,
reward and command it. To do this he practically
repeats much of what he had already said on the
subjects of Honour and Obedience‚ viz. that the state of
