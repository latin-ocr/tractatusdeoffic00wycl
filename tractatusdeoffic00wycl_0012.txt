viii INTRODUCTION.

is committed unto them by God is proved by the per-
mission Satan sought to injure Job, and the words of
Christ to Pilate. True that when these rulers sin
against God we must faithfully resist them to the death,
but their offences against men should be borne patiently,
and the result be left in God's hands. Thus we may
conclude generally that resistance to royal authority is
a grievous sin, nor is it less clear that kings have a right
to tribute from their subjects‚ and specially from the
clergy maintained by the royal alms. But the present
state of the Church agrees ill with these conclusionS,
and it is not unreasonable to see in this the chief cause
of the ills of the Church Militant.

All this shows the more clearly the need of an ex-
position of the royal power, and of its true relations to
the sacerdotal. Now St. Augustine repeatedly tells us
that Kings are the bearers of God's image just as
bishops are of Christ’s, or in other words that the king
bears the image, and is the vicar of Christ's Godhead,
and the priest of His rnanhood, and that therefore the
king must rule the priest. As regards the dignity of
the two offices we must distinguish between the palpable
dignity which is unto the world, and the impalpable‚
which is unto God. Thus the true dignity of the priest
is superior to the earthly dignity of the king, but out-
ward or palpable honour (honor sensibilis) is to be
rendered more freely to kings than to priests. Even
with bad kings this must continue the case, for though
they are kings only equivocally and without possessing
real lordship‚ yet they are rational creatures in whom
is not only the imprint but the image of the Trinity,
and they possess power conferred on them for the good
os the Church which they may use rightly. Those who
maintain that the Church can carry on her warfare
without a king but not without priestS, forget not only
the kingly relation within tho soul, but that in such
timcs as the Church was without a civil king she was
