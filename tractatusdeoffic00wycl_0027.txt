INTRoDUCTmN. xxiii

to be believed in so far as they founded their teaching
on Scripture. This is the test by which we must try
the validity of all papal mandates for neither bulls nor
excommunications are to be respected save in so far as
they have scripture authority. This leads to another
denunciation of the medieval system of excommunication,
with which the Chapter ends.

Chapter X (pp. 231—245) is concerned with the
arguments brought forward contra tria dicta 39 ca⁰ libri
proximi ¹. These dicta deal respectively with the custom
of excommunication, the study by the clergy of the
Civil Law, and the obedience due from Bishops to their
secular Prince.

As to excommunication Wyclif does not add much to
what he has already said. He again insists that all true
excommunication is from God, and ought therefore to
be received joyfully as for the sufferer’s good, but that
without divine authority mere human excommunication
is nothing, and should be received with contempt and
sorrow for those who pronounce it. The moral of this
is that prelates should be slow to speak‚ especially as
regards things neutral. This, to the great harm of the
Church‚ they forget‚ and through their pride and
perverse practices comes ruin.

On the subject of the Civil Law the language now
employed is much stronger than that of Chapter VII.
Civil and Canon Law are both unhesitatingly condemned,
and their study is only commended as enabling men to
prove the Pope’s ancient subordination to the Emperor.

¹ Ι quote these words in order to draw attention to them, but no satis-
factory explanation of the reference has occurred to me. Excornmunication
is treated of at great length on pages 166—176; the Civil Law on 188—195;
the obedience due from Bishops to Princes passim. The reference thus
appears to be to the present book, which is regarded as in two parts, i.e.
treatise and supplement. Cp. Wyclif’s ‘quod in isto tractatu in grosso
senserim‚’ on p. 280. But the ‘39⁰ Capitulo,' like the ‘380' at the
beginning of our Chapter VIII (p. 195), where the reference seems to be to
p. 143, is not easily to be understood. Compare also the words patet ex

dictis 36 capitulo at the beginning of our Chapter VI (p. 119). [A.W.P.]
