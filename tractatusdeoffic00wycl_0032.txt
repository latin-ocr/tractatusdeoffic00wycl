xxviii INTRODUCTION.

to our treatise having followed immediately upon its
predecessor. Thus the controversy as to the privileges
of the Sanctuary of Westminster1 is twice alluded to
(pp. 157 and 169), but in a manner which allows us to
imagine that at the time Wyclif was writing public
interest on the subject had greatly subsided. The
schism in the papacy is several times mentioned (pp.
120,17; 121, 13; 123, 6; 126, 31; 219, 25; 226, 7).
The first of these references shows that Urban's Bull of
November 1378 had already been issued ; in the second
there is a difficulty in the text which may lead to slightly
different vieWS. According to our MSS. Wyclif writes ε
et revera latet nos utrum ipse [sc. Robertus Gibornensis‚
i. e. Clement VII] vel Gregorius Xl²⁶⁸ occupat patri-s
monium Crz'stz' iniustius. It has been suggested that
Gregorius XI²⁴⁸ is here a slip of the pen for Urbanus
Vsus, in which case Wyclif at the time of writing was
already disabused of the good hopes of Urban which he
had conceived at the time of his election. On the other
hand a few lines further down Urban is distinctly
spoken osas papa noster, and it seems at least possible
to construe the text as it stands, taking its meaning to
be: ‘and it is hard to say whether the present Anti-
pope is a worse usurper than was his legitimate prede-
cessor.⁹ In any case the difference of date cannot be
important, for in one passage of the Dc Ecclesia Wyclif
had already classed Pope and Antipope together as
duo pseudomonachi. The remaining references to the
schism are quite general in terms, and an allusion to the
poor soldiers still unransomed in Spain perfectly har-
monizes with the date 1379 which the connexion of
this eighth book of the Summa with its immediate
predecessor inclines us to assign to it.
