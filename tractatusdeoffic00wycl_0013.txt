also without a Cesarean clergy; they forget also the
unanimous teaching of Christ, St. Peter and St. Paul,
and the holy Doctors, that the King must have pre-
eminence in the state. Nor is it less true that a froward
priest also is to be honoured for the sake of his office.
Moses and Aaron, as priests, were made the channels
of blessings they were powerless to affect, and the gift
of prophecy was granted to the wicked Caiaphas in
virtue of his office. Benediction and other priestly acts
are not acts of merit but acts of official power, and in
virtue of this official dignity even foreknown priests are
to be honoured. But whereas the bad king is to be
obeyed with the seven works of mercy and especially by
patience, since he only wrongs men by an excessive use
of hisrightful power, for the bad priest who wrongs God
there is no room for patience, and the obedience we owe
to him is the obedience of prudent reproof, stern con-
viction and brave resistance.

Chapter ΙΙ (pp. 22—46) is mainly occupied with a
discussion as to the nature of honour with a view to
determining the relative honour to be paid to Kings
and to the Clergy. After explaining the relations as
to honour which subsist between God and His creatures,
Wyclif proceeds in the case of human honour to dis-
tinguish between that due to dignity or office and that
due to merit. The chief point which he brings out is
that no one is to be honoured by reason of the con-
nexion of his clerical office with any lay dignity, such
connexion being vicious and any honour paid to it
blasphemous To forbid clerical marriage while per-
mitting the clerical tenure of lay offices is to strain
away a gnat and swallow a camel. Priests who are
tempted by the outward signs of respect accorded to
the holders of lay offices confuse substance and shadow3
for as honour is the reward of virtue, it must be some-
thing which exceeds virtue, and therefore cannot be a
mere sign, which may be bestowed by anybody. The
