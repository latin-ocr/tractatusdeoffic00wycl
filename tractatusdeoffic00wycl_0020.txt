xvi INTRODUCTION.

bear arms, is evident. But if the lords are to transfer
the goods of heretics to the righteous there must be
theologians able to discern wlzat heresy is and to expose
the blasphemous usurpation by which Christ's pretended
vicar claims to control kings.

In the rest of the chapter (pp. 127 sqq.) Wyclif con-
siders three objections to his views, all asserting the
Pope’s pretensions on the general ground that the
spiritual power must precede and control the temporal.
To the argument from history he replies that if the
Pope has deposed an emperor (or rather has taught that
he should be deposed) the Emperor has more frequently
deposed Popes, and he proceeds to attack certain posi-
tions advanced by the Abbot of Chertsey ¹, which, if
admitted, would abolish the royal jurisdiction on the
ground that secular judges cannot pronounce on ques-
tions of sin, and would remove the clergy from sub-
jection to any secular prince, claiming for them the
right of pit and gallows and all other incidents of lord-
ship. Briefly repelling the Abbot’s attack on the secular
clergy Wyclif has no difficulty in showing that judges
chosen from the regular orders have no peculiar
competence to pronounce on the relative enormity
of sins save, perhaps, from their exceptional personal
experience of them, and that underneath all his
opponent's arguments lies the double confusion (a)
of the Church with its clerical members, (b) of the
Church militant with the Church triumphant. The
second attack revives under a slightly different form
the fallacy as to delegated authority which Wyclif had
already refuted in Chapter V (pp. 90, 91), and he passes
from it to 3 general exposition of the advantage which
would accrue to the Church, if the clergy would welcome
instead os repelling, the attack of the lay lords. The

‘ theologiae inceptor.‘
