X INTRODUCTION.

highest honour of all is the approval of G0d; well-
measured praise from a good man is also a real honour:
but to seek honour without regard to virtue is to liken
ourselves to the figtree cursed by Christ. Yet this vain
pursuit of mere worldly honour is especially rife among
learned bodies (in castris scholasticis).

So much by way of prelude: Wyclif now attacks his
rnain point of the relative honour due to kings and
priests, and at the outset has to face a formidable diffi-
culty. After the disappearance of Count Baldwin of
Flanders his brother Henry reigned as Emperor at
Constantinople in his stead, well and wisely enough.
But in the Church of St. Sophia he had the temerity to
place the Patriarch of Constantinople on his left hand
and apparently on a lower seat (iuxta scabellum pedum
suorum iaz sinislra parte). This outrage drew down on
him a vehement reproof from Pope Innocent III (the
Pope to whom King John had to surrender his crown),
and this reproof in which the sacerdotal pretensions are
very strongly stated, was enshrined in the Decretals.
‘ Now in considering this decree,' says Wyclif, ‘we must
be on our guard against its ignorant interpreters 3’ in
other words he proceeds to meet it by a series of dis-
tinctions. Thus it is granted that the priestly order
excels the kingly, but in a special, not in a secular or
civil sense. The priestly dignity can be honoured by
God solelyper accidens, quite apart from the infinitely
higher claim to honour which virtue may confer on it.
And if the Patriarch is to be honoured with outward
observance in proportion to his priestly dignity, then no
seat will be good enough for so great a man! But
while the Pope and clergy owe their endowments to
emperors and kings they must be subject to thern in all
temporal matters; their superiority is solely spiritual
and lies in the call made upon them to live a humbler
and more Christlike life, and it is no more impossible
for them to be at once superior and subject than to be,
