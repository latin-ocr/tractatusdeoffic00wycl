xviii INTRODUCTION.

as referring to the clergy as the ‘wings of the Church’
this long Chapter comes to an end.

Chapter VII (pp. 152-192) is devoted to the exposition
of three laws whose enactment would be for the good
alike of Church and State:

(1) that Bishops should be obliged to look to the
state of the clergy in their respective DioceseS.

(2) that the King, through his BishopS‚ should
enforce the residence in all parishes of learned
and zealous curates.

(3) for the extension, defence and reform of the
theological faculty.

For the carrying out of the first of these laws Wyclif
looks to the revival of the disciplinary power of the
provincial Church Councils‚ who should enquire and
report as to the number and quality of the clergy, and

astical complaints should be brought. Bishops who
allow their clergy to live secular lives should be
punished by the confiscation of their revenueS, to retain
which they must render good service to the realm.
Such confiscation would be no wrong, for when any
human institution is found to contain error, its founders
or their representatives must correct it (cp. end of Chap.
ΙΙΙ, p. 64), and the steady deterioration of the Church
is abundant proof of the error committed in its endow-
ment.

Of Wyclif's second law the first corollary is that all
curates, native or foreign, must reside in their benefices,
and the country will thus be rid of the curse of foreign

his blasphemous pretension to be lord-in-chief of all
benefices, and able to make whatever he decrees lawful.
Where curates fail to fulfil their duty the people must
withhold all pay, and run the risk of excommunication.
This in the fourteenth century was no light matter, since
forty days after sentence was pronounced the offender,
