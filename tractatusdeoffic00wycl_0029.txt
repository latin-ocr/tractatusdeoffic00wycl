INTRODUCTION. xxv

schism of the Church is the following of the traditions
of men in preference to the study of theology.

Since fighting may be lawful and meritorious, how
and for what should the secular arm do battle? This is
the subject of Chapter XII, and apparently takes the
place of the ‘fourth principal objection,’ which the
opening words of Chapter IX led us to expect. Wars
waged for the love of God are right, Wyclif answers,
and no others. A King may lawfully desire so much
temporal dominion as will suffice for a rule in conformity
with Christ’s law, but universal dominion is impossible:
(a) because distance would make it inefficient‚ (b) be-
cause of differences of language and of manners,
(c) because it could never be kept together. Only
under exceptional circumstances may a king lawfully
desire to rule two kingdoms. The law of nature, the·
example of Christ, and the dictates of human reason all
prove the wickedness of war in Christendom. We have
no right to invade foreign nations save for their own
good, and when we pretend that we possess this plea we
may ask ourselves‚ why we do not begin our mission at
home, why we use such bad means to our end, and why
we often punish the innocent as heavily as the guilty.
Sin is the inevitable concomitant of war, and inasmuch
as we ought to submit to be deprived of every natural
good rather than commit a fault, wars are manifestly
sinful and foolish. The faithful should not be too
forward in their own defence, for every one should be
ready to die, and the clergy especially, who claim to
represent the Apostles, must follow them in their toil
and suffering. A theologian will teach us the true
doctrine as to war, but the chief thing needful is to
remember that Christ is the best Master, and that it
is His teaching and His alone that we must follow.
Hence the general sense of our whole treatise (quod in
toto isto tractatu in grosso senserim) may be summed up
in three principles: (1) that the clergy, and especially
