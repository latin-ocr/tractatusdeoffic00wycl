INTRODUCTION. xvii

third objection is more important, for it points out that
he has as yet given no clear answer as to which of the
two jurisdictions is to have precedence, and this he now
proceeds to do (pp. 137-143). The more perfect state
he shows, has not necessarily the more perfect authority,
else any authority of any priest would be more perfect
than that of the king to whom he is subject. It is
therefore probable that the king's authority is for many
reasons more perfect, e. g. as answering to Christ's God-
head, whereas the priest is the vicar of His manhood.
Certainly the reverse cannot hold true while the Church
owes her property to the alms of earthly princes, while
the Pope has no appellate authority in temporal matters,
and while Churches pay tribute to the Emperor.
Wyclif’s own decision is parallel with his views as to
honour at the end of Chapter ΙΙ. Temporally the King
is greater, spiritually the Pope, though the latter may
destroy the spiritual superiority by trying to double
with it the kingly; but to say which power is greater
simpliciter is as impossible as it would have been to
know that John the Baptist had no greater than himself
among the children of men before this was revealed by
Christ. Both powers are from Goel, but the kingly was
the earlier in time, and we must not misunderstand the
meaning of the priestly consecration of kings. This
was no rite of the primitive church, and is purely minis-
terial in its character, conferring on its performers no
claim to superior authority.

Lastly (pp. 147—152) Wyclif carries the war into the
enemy's country by asking‚ is the priesthood inherent
in the clergy? and answering in the negative. At first
men were both kings and priests. The division between
clergy and laity dates from the giving of the law, and
was only completed at the advent of the law of grace
by the injunction on the clergy to live pure exproprz‘etarz'e
tanquam animal racz‘onale ad celestia aspirans, and so
with a mystical interpretation of the sixty-eighth psalm
