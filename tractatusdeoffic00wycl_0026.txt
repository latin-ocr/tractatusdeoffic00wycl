xxii INTRODUCTION.

The last objection noticed in this Chapter is the
alleged irredemptibility (according to Leviticus ch. 28)
of things consecrated. Of this plea Wyclif disposes in
three ways: (1) on the ground that the Jewish law was
wholly ceremonial and so is not to be literally observed
by our priests ; (2) because the consecration to which it
referred did not, and could not, apply to land 3 (3) on the
broad principle that whatever Jew or Christian has vowed
is to be faithfully observed‚ but that it is no breach
of a vow to correct its abuse or improve its use, and he
ends the Chapter with a vehement denunciation of the
evils which endowments have introduced into the
Church.

With Chapter VIII there can be no doubt that the
De Officio ,Regis originally came to an end. But to the
four points considered in this chapter Wyclif thought fit
pro complemento finali to add four others, which form the
subjects of Chapters IX—XII. In the first of these (pp.
217—230) the objection that on his showing instead of
the Emperor and all Bishops swearing obedience to the
Pope‚ the Pope with his cardinals‚ and the friars, would
have to swear obedience to kingS, leads to an examina-
tion of the whole question of oaths. These, it is owned
may savour of worldly law or os a desire for pre-eminence-
Nevertheless they are lawful, and since the Pope exacts
them from Archbishops, a fortiori the King may exact
them from his liegemen ; from the Pope and other
distant subjects in general terms ; from those who have
special privileges specifically and distinctly. It is
especially important that such oaths should be taken,
through their provincials, by the friars, who are at present
willing to accept all the advantages which may accrue to
their communities from the merits of individuals, while
they disown responsibility for their offences. The claim
of the Bishop of Rome to temporal monarchy is the pro-
mulgation ofa new law, whereas the Apostles and Fathers
were content with the Law of Christ, and only claimed
